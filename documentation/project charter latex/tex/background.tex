Our team has little to no experience in designing mobile applications, and we are required to design a language recognition application that studied the Python libraries of neural networks to instantiate the correct pronunciations of words, the requirement that is stated by the sponsors that the computing logic of the application needs to be computing in the cloud either using Microsoft Azure, Amazon WPS, or Google Cloud, which then will tie into an Android application guided user interface
designed using Android Studio and Java and only display the results of the logic.
