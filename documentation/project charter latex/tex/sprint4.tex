\paragraph{Sprint Retrospective}
In Sprint 4, we expanded the UML diagram to include all additional details for the server-side architecture. We were also able to test the SSH and SFTP access to make sure they connect to the dummy web service. An empty app was made that only connected to the dummy web service and was able to confirm that it connected. We are still working on implementing the server-side architecture.
