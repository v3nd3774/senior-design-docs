\paragraph{Sprint Retrospective}
In Sprint 1, we completed our research on basic human speech features, neural networks, and Fourier transform and Formant frequencies. We also researched what we would need our server to do and what environment to work in. We recorded samples of 100 common US English words for the database. We are still working on implementing Fourier transform, Formant frequency, and spectogram. We are also still int eh process of building a prototype of our app.
