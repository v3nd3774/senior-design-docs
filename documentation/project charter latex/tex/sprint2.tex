\subsubsection{Sprint 2}

\paragraph{Sprint Goal}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Ensure compatibility on all platforms such as Android, Apple, and Windows using Xamarin or other development tools.
    \item  Gather all data and supplies required for Android application development.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Sprint Retrospective}
In Sprint 2, we completed the SRS documentation and implemented the Fourier transform, Formant frequenct, and spectogram in python. We are still trying to decide if we want to implement the app only in Android Studio or if it should be written in Xamarin so that it can be used by Apple devices as well.
